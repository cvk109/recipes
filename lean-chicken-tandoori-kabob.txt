ngredients for up to 4 servings (or up to 6 skewers):

1lb raw chicken breasts
Tandoori Sauce:

3/4 cup 2% Greek yogurt
juice from 1 large lemon
1 tbsp minced garlic or garlic paste
1 tsp fresh ginger
1 tbsp cumin
1 tsp coriander
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cayenne
1 .5 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tsp allspice
Himalayan pink salt & pepper to taste
 

Garnish:

thinly sliced red onion
cilantro
 

Utensils:

NuWave Oven
Wooden kabob skewers
 

Steps:

Trim the fat from raw chicken breasts. Then, cut the chicken breasts into long slender pieces to create tenders and set aside.
Mix together all of the ingredients for the tandoori sauce in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt & pepper.
Add the chicken breast tenders and stir with a spatula, ensuring that all of the tenders are covered. Cover the bowl and store in the refrigerator over night in order to let the chicken marinate. At least 8 hours but better at up to 24 hours.
Soak wooden skewers in water for 15 minutes prior to assembling the kabobs in order to keep them from burning when baking in the oven or grilling.
Assemble the kabobs by piercing the chicken tenders length-wise so that 2 tenders can cover about 80% of the skewer.
If you are using the NuWave Oven, simply set the grill 3-inches from the bottom and place the kabobs on the grill. Set the oven to 350F and select “Cook Time” and set the timer to 8 minutes. If you are using a traditional oven, set the oven to 350F. For best results, place the kabobs on a baking rack. If you do not have one, simply place the kabobs on a baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes.
After 8 minutes, turn the kabobs on the other side and cook for an additional 11 minutes. If you are using a traditional oven, follow the same steps and flip the kabobs after 8-10 minutes.
Remove the kabobs from the NuWave Oven, or traditional oven, and garnish with fresh lemon juice, thinly sliced red onions and freshly chopped cilantro.
